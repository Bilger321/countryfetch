## Dependencies

[DENO](https://deno.land/)

## Installation

clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CondensedMilk7/countryfetch.git
```

navigate to the cloned repo folder and run install:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The app should now be installed.

alternatively, you can compile it yourself and store it in your local bin directory (might be safer):

```bash
deno compile --allow-all main.ts
cp ./countryfetch  ~/.local/bin
```

If after this your shell cannot find countryfetch, this means you haven't added your local bin to PATH. Either add it to PATH, or make an alias in your .bashrc or .zshrc:

```bash
alias countryfetch="~/.local/bin/countryfetch"
```

## Usage

```bash
countryfetch <arguments>
```

available arguments:

- `find <country-name>` - Find country information by name. Country names cannot have whitespaces, use kebab-case or snake_case instead.
- `sync` - Synchronizes databes, stores it in localStorage. This is done automatically, but can be triggered manually.
- `random` - Get random country information.

example:

```
$ countryfetch find germany

# output:

Country:	ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany
Languages:	German
Capital:	Berlin
Region:		Europe
Population:	83,240,525
Currencies:	Euro [â‚¬](EUR)

```

## Known issues

- App will not match names that include "-", which is replaced by whitespace by program.
